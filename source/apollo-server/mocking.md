`addMocksToSchema` is the function that `mockServer` uses under the hood. Given an instance of GraphQLSchema and a mock object, it modifies the schema in place to return mock data for any valid query that is sent to the server. If `mocks` is not passed, the defaults will be used for each of the scalar types. If `preserveResolvers` is set to `true`, existing resolve functions will not be overwritten to provide mock data. This can be used to mock some parts of the server and not others.
`mockServer` will set the `context` to `{}` when invoking `graphql`, which means that the mock functions could use that context to store additional information for mocking, such as relationships between different types.
