description: How to install the Apollo GraphQL server tools.

Apollo GraphQL Tools is a collection of functions and an opinionated guide for how to build a GraphQL server in JavaScript.


```txt
npm install graphql-tools
```

The Apollo GraphQL tools are not just useful for building servers, they can also be used in the browser, for example to mock a backend during development or testing. Even though our guide recommends a specific way of building GraphQL servers, you can use these tools even if you don't follow our guide; they work with any GraphQL-JS schema, and each tool can be useful on its own.
